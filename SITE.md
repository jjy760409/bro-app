# BroApp Vision & Architecture

## 1. Vision
BroApp is a sleek, hyper-modern, no-nonsense AI food tracker for gym lovers and health enthusiasts. It emphasizes rapid logging ("just snap a pic"), direct and brutally honest health scores, and premium aesthetic minimalism. 

## 2. Core Themes
- **Vibe:** Cyberpunk gym, dark mode luxury, high contrast, unapologetic.
- **Goal:** Frictionless food tracking. No manual searching, just AI camera scanning.

## 3. Stitch Project ID
- *Project ID will be generated upon first iteration and stored in `stitch.json`.*

## 4. Sitemap (Current)
- [x] `index.html` (Entry point / Landing)
- [x] `App.jsx` (Main Router)
- [x] `components/CameraView.jsx` (Core image capture)
- [x] `components/AnalysisResult.jsx` (AI readout)
- [x] `components/History.jsx` (Past logs)
- [x] `components/DietaryProfile.jsx` (User settings)
- [x] `components/Paywall.jsx` (Subscription handling)
- [x] `components/LegalCenter.jsx` (Terms of service)

## 5. Roadmap
- **[ ] Leaderboard / Achievements** (`components/Leaderboard.jsx`): A competitive screen where users can see badges ("10 Day Streak", "Protein God", "Sugar Avoider") or compare their health score tracking.
- **[ ] Daily Macro Ring** (`components/MacroDashboard.jsx`): A visual dashboard summarizing today's total calories vs goal.
- **[ ] Roast Mode Toggle** (`components/RoastSettings.jsx`): Setting to let the AI be brutally funny/mean about bad food choices.

## 6. Creative Freedom
- Think about social accountability. Should users be able to challenge a friend to a "clean eating week"?
- Visualizing progress: How can we make checking past history look cooler than just a list? (Graphs, charts?)
